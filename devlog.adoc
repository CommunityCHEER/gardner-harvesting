== Part 1: Making React Native Happen
Or, making the frontend.

=== Why React Native?

I chose to use React Native for two simple reasons: it's cross-platform and I'm already familiar with the React workflow. I'm open to the idea that there are better alternatives, but I feel like React Native is a safe place to start.

=== Getting Started - 2024-06-20

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup[The React Native docs] recommend using https://expo.dev[the Expo framework]. I got it set up and running with https://bun.sh[the Bun runtime]. I found that I had to use `expo start` with the `--tunnel` flag to get hot-reloading working. This appears to be a fairly common necessity stemming from any number of local or network-wide configurations. The Expo docs claim it slows down hot-reloading, but it's been pretty speedy for me. Overall, I'm not too concerned by `--tunnel`. I did have some trouble with an `ngrok` dependency for the `--tunnel` feature, but I fixed it by re-initializing the repo and installing it in the project specifically with `bun install`.

This highlights one of my gripes with the JS ecosystem. I find that it's really easy to get into messy situations with dependencies, especially when Bun and Node get mixed. The error messages never help. At least starting over pretty consistently fixes things.

=== A Camera Component

A core function of the app is the ability to take a picture with the phone camera and process the image data. Thus, there needs to be some camera view in the app.

==== Starting with VisionCamera - 2024-06-20

Initially, I thought something like a camera view would be simple. I thought that many system-interaction components would be provided by the OS (hence "Native"). I was wrong. I had to find a pre-made library for a camera view component and functions for handling camera permissions and image capture. I arrived at https://react-native-vision-camera.com/[VisionCamera], since it seemed like the highest-quality option. Since it "relies on native code" footnote:[See https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/issues/2670[this issue]], I have to use a https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/[development build] instead of https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/[Expo Go]. Initially, I thought this meant rebuilding for any changes, but once I actually started reading the docs (and once I had an actual development build on my phone), I understood how it really works: it's just hot-reloading but in its own dedicated app. {shrug}

I ended the night with a working camera view. It just shows what the camera currently sees. There's also a dedicated page for requesting camera permissions. This all works on the development build.

==== Taking a Photo - 2024-06-21

I followed the VisionCamera docs to begin the code to take a photo. I started by trying to make a button that calls `takePhoto()`, but I was having problems that I thought were related to plugging an async function into a react-native `Button` component's `onPress` prop. I tried plugging in a sync function and got the same error. I read the docs, and it turns out the native button component actually doesn't take any child components, just a `title` prop for the text with which to label the button.

The `takePhoto` function saves the photo to a temporary file and returns an object with some image data and a `path` property. To demonstrate the basic photo capture functionality, I added a stateful vairable `photo` and a conditionally rendered `Image` component that displays the image at the path returned by `takePhoto`.

=== OAuth

Another core feature of the app is tracking _who_ is submitting data, on top of simply tracking attendance at harvests. In the interest of not rolling my own auth, I decided to stick with OAuth, starting with Google and ICloud (for ease of use with Android and iOS systems respectively).

==== Getting Started with Google OAuth - 2024-06-21

I've never worked with any sort of authentication system before, so I've got a lot of learning to do. I decided to start with Google OAuth because I'm more familiar with their account systems and UI standards (I anticipate having to work with some sort of app management site). I found https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin[Google's own React Native sign-in library], which has setup documentation for Expo. The Expo docs themselves also have setup info for Google signin. I followed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDeKTPQzvR4&t=562s[this video] for the most part. Notably, I got the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint from the EAS keystore, and I'm not making a webapp so I didn't do any of the web configuration.

==== Back on the Horse - 2024-06-24

I took a couple of days off, but I got back to work with a proper schedule in place. The first thing I did was establish tab navigation in the app, following https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/tabs/[the docs]. Then, on the 'User' page, I continued following the aformentioned tutorial video. At the point where the actual Google APIs begin to be used, I began encountering errors. At this point, I decided to look for a different source. I thought that I might be watching a video that was out-of-date or simply didn't quite have what I was looking for. This was mainly sparked by the realization that the repo I mentioned earlier wasn't mentioned in the video. So, I found https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vojHmGUGUGc[a different tutorial posted by Supabase] that used that repo, rolled back my code to the working camera, and started fresh.

This worked out great. Using the google sign-in button is very straightforward. I prematurely shut down the google cloud project thinking I didn't need it, but I lost very little progress. Right now, I can get google user info by signing in using google play services on the device.
